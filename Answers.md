1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

With server-side routing, the user receives all of their data over again every time they make requests from the browser. This can be efficient, in that they only receive the specific data they want at that time. 

With client-side routing, the user receives all of the data they'll ever need when they initially load the app. In this way,we can reuse components across an app and quickly, without loads and refreshes, display what the user wants to see.
